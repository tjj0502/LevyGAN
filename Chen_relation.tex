The Levy-area process \( (W^1,W^2,A) \) (where \( W^1, W^2 \) are two independent Brownian Motions and \( A_t := \frac{1}{2} \left( \int_0^t W^1_u dW^2_u\ - \int_0^t W^2_u dW^1_u\ \right) \) is their associated Levy-area) obeys the following version of the Chen relation:

\[ A_{0,t} = A_{0,s} + A_{s,t} + \frac{1}{2}\left( W^1_{0,s} W^2_{s,t} - W^2_{0,s} W^1_{s,t} \right)  \]
where \( 0 \leq s \leq t \). Furthermore, any process that follows this relation is again a Levy-area process. In other words the distribution of Levy-area is the unique distribution (conditional on W) for which the relation above holds.
